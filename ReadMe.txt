2) Run the EncoderGUI.py file to encode a message using a graphical user interface.
3) The encrypted file will be outputted to the same directory as the programs.
4) Run the DecoderGUI.py file to decode the previously encrypted file.
5) The decoded message file will be outputted to the desktop. 

Using the terminal:
1) Unpack the .zip file into whatwever directory you wish.
2) Run the TextEncoder.py file to encode a message using the python ide terminal. 
The terminal allows you to input a message just like the GUI file, or choose an existing 
text file to encode. 
3) The encrypted text file will be placed in the same directory as the programs.
